# YOLO-Alpaca-Detector
An object detection system that uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** to detect alpacas in images and videos.   This project demonstrates how to train and deploy a custom YOLO model on a specialized dataset (Alpacas ðŸ¦™), enabling real-time detection for fun, research, or farm monitoring applications.
